# SymmetryBreaking
MATLAB code for simulating symmetry-breaking dynamics of cell-cell interaction networks
========================

MATLAB library developed to produce the results for the paper 

[Stanoev, Angel, Christian Schr√∂ter, and Aneta Koseska. "Robustness and timing of cellular differentiation through population-based symmetry breaking." BioRxiv (2019): 578898.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/04/27/578898.full.pdf).

-------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------

The code has been tested successfully with older versions of MATLAB (at least R2015b (8.6)) and with the latest version (R2019b (9.7)) on Windows and macOS.

Using the framework
===================

Good starting point is running the figure-generating or movie-generating scripts, as they reproduce the main results and simulations. In each figure class the subfigure plots are generated by a separate function.
